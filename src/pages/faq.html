        <b><h3>FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)</h3></b><br>

        Version 1.0.<br><br>

        Last Revised: January 27, 2023.<br><br>

        <b>What is a Smart Contract Mail?<br><br></b>
        - It is an email that the user can send and receive emails on the blockchain using just his wallet address.<br>
        Note: With smart contracts, the user can control who can send emails to him and he also can set a fee to be protected
        against SPAMs.<br><br>

        <b>Can I send an email to a regular mail provider, like Gmail, Outlook and Apple Mail?<br><br></b>
        - No, the application was built on the blockchain and the blockchain itself cannot communicate with applications
        outside of it.<br><br>

        <b>Can I send an email to an address from another blockchain?<br><br></b>
        - No, the application is not cross-chain.
        It cannot communicate with other blockchains unless you use a bridge (not recommended).<br><br>

        <b>Can I send an email to a user who doesn't have an account?<br><br></b>
        - No, you can only send emails to addresses with created accounts.<br><br>

        <b>Who can read the email?<br><br></b>
        - Only the sender and the receiver can read the email. The email is end-to-end encrypted.<br>
        Note: Because of this, we cannot scan your email or file for viruses.<br>
        ONLY OPEN EMAILS OR DOWNLOAD FILES FROM TRUSTED SOURCES.<br><br>

        <b>Can I attach a file to the email?<br><br></b>
        - Yes, you can send an email with a file attached to it.<br>
        Note: You can attach a file of up to 1 MB.<br><br>

        <b>How many addresses can I send an email to?<br><br></b>
        - You can only send an email to one address.<br>
        Note: Use a Feed if you need to send to several addresses.<br><br>

        <b>What do I need to have to send an email?<br><br></b>
        - You must have at least 1 HashBox Mail credit to send an email and some MATIC to pay the network fee.<br><br>

        <b>What are HashBox Mail Credits (HBM)?<br><br></b>
        - They are the tokens used to send emails, create Feeds and add Contacts.<br>
        Note: HashBox Mail credits are not investment.<br><br>

        <b>How can I buy a credit?<br><br></b>
        - You can buy a credit by clicking the "Buy Credits" button at the top of the application and following the
        instructions.<br><br>

        <b>How much cost a credit?<br><br></b>
        - The credit has a fixed price of 0.008 MATIC (Polygon Network).<br><br>

        <b>Can I sell a credit?<br><br></b>
        - Yes, you can sell by clicking the "Sell Credits" button at the top of the application and following the
        instructions.<br><br>

        <b>How many HashBox Mail Credits are there?<br><br></b>
        - There are only 10 billion credits and no more credits will be created in the future.<br><br>

        <b>What happens to the credit after I send an email?<br><br></b>
        - The credit goes back into the application and you can buy it again by clicking the "Buy Credits" button at the top
        of the application.<br><br>

        <b>Do I need to spend a credit to create an account?<br><br></b>
        - No, to create an account you just need to pay the transaction (network fee) to register your Mailbox (public key)
        on the blockchain.<br><br>

        <b>What is the Mailbox?<br><br></b>
        - Mailbox is your identification on the blockchain. It contains your public key so people can send emails and
        files to you.<br>
        Note: To backup your Mailbox, check our <a href="/help#BackupMailbox" target="_blank">Help</a>.<br><br>

        <b>Why do I need to sign a message every time I access the application?<br><br></b>
        - The message signature is the only way to decrypt your messages, files and contacts, as it is used to decrypt your
        private key.<br>
        Note: DO NOT SHOW YOUR HASHBOX MAIL SIGNATURE TO ANYONE.<br><br>

        <b>Where is my private key located?<br><br></b>
        - Your private key is encrypted and stored on the HashBox Mail servers and you are the only one to decrypt it with your
        message signature.<br>
        Note: You can download it at any time from the "Account" section in Settings.<br><br>

        <b>Can you read my HashBox Mail signature?<br><br></b>
        - No, your HashBox Mail signature is never sent to our servers, just the signature hash is sent to our server as a way of
        identifying who is requesting the encrypted private key.<br><br>

        <b>What is the "Fee" input when I compose an email?<br><br></b>
        - It's the value set by the receiver to be paid to receive an email.<br>
        It's paid the first time someone sends an email or every time the receiver receives an email.<br><br>

        <b>How can I set a Fee?<br><br></b>
        - In Settings, in the "Account" section, you can set the value and the frequency.<br>
        Note: for more instructions, check our <a href="help#SetFee" target="_blank" style="text-align: center;">Help</a>.<br><br>

        <b>Why is the Fee input sometimes blocked when I compose an email?<br><br></b>
        - It happens when you are allowed to send free emails to the receiver.<br><br>

        <b>How can I set a free emails to an address?<br><br></b>
        - In Settings, in the "Account" section, you can add the address to the "Whitelist" or remove it.<br>
        Note: for more instructions, check our <a href="help#SetFreeMail" target="_blank" style="text-align: center;">Help</a>.<br><br>

        <b>What is a Feed?<br><br></b>
        - Feed is a list of subscribers (group of addresses) who receive emails, just like a newsfeed that the subscribers
        receive the emails as long as the Feed is active and they are subscribed.<br><br>

        <b>Do I need to spend a credit to send a Feed?<br><br></b>
        - No, to send a Feed you don't need to spend any credits, you will only spend credits to create a Feed.<br><br>

        <b>Can I get paid when someone subscribes to my Feed?<br><br></b>
        - Yes, you can set a price for your Feed and be paid when someone subscribes to your Feed.<br><br>

        <b>How can I create a Feed?<br><br></b>
        - You must have 10,000 HBMs to create a Feed with 30-day Renewal Period.<br>
        Note: The 30-day Renewal Period is the default, there is no longer duration.<br><br>

        <b>What is this "30-day Renewal Period"?<br><br></b>
        - This is the period that the creator of the Feed can send emails to his subscribers.<br><br>

        <b>Does the Feed creator need to renew the feed?<br><br></b>
        - Yes, the creator of the Feed needs to spend 10,000 HBMs to renew the Feed every 30 days.<br><br>

        <b>I created/renewed the Feed now, can I change the duration, price, payment type, withdraw or delete the Feed?<br><br></b>
        - No, you must wait for the 30-day Renewal Period before changing any information in your Feed, withdrawing or deleting
        the Feed.<br><br>

        <b>What is the "Subscription Period"?<br><br></b>
        - This is the period that the subscribers can receive emails from the creator of the Feed.<br><br>

        <b>What kind of Subscription Periods can I choose to create a Feed?<br><br></b>
        - A Feed can be created with the Subscription Period of 30, 60, 90, 180 or 365 days.<br>
        Note: If you choose a Subscription Period longer than 30 days, you will need to renew the Feed at least once.<br>
        Example: If you choose Subscription Period of 90 days, you will need to renew your Feed twice (30 days after creation
        and 30 days after renewal).<br><br>

        <b>What kind of "total of users" can I choose to create a Feed?<br><br></b>
        - A Feed can be created having a total of 3, 6, 12, 24 or unlimited users.<br><br>

        <b>Do subscribers need to renew their subscription?<br><br></b>
        - Yes, the subscribers need to pay the Feed price to subscribe again after the Subscription Period ends.<br><br>

        <b>Can the users unsubscribe from a Feed?<br><br></b>
        - Yes, the users can unsubscribe from a Feed while the Feed is active.<br>
        Note: The user will not be able to unsubscribe if the Feed is not active anymore (the Renewal Period has ended).<br><br>

        <b>What happens when a user unsubscribe from a Feed before his Subscription Period ends?<br><br></b>
        - The user is refunded according to the amount he paid and the time he was subscribed.<br><br>

        <b>Why can some Feeds not be displayed in the list?<br><br></b>
        - It happens when those Feeds have a rating of less than 5.<br>
        To keep the website with quality content, it won't list any low rated Feed.<br>
        Note: All Feeds can be accessed with the application running on localhost.<br><br>

        <b>What are Contacts?<br><br></b>
        - Contacts is a section to add, edit or remove a Contact. With a Contact, you can send an email, file or token using a
        nickname (custom name) instead of a hexadecimal address.<br>
        Example: You can send an email/file/token to "Silvio" instead of "0x55555E09bc39767C48Eb02863029Cb0838a80f2B".<br><br>

        <b>How and where is the Contact stored?<br><br></b>
        - The Contact is encrypted and stored on the blockchain and only the Contact creator can decrypt the information.<br>
        Note: You can use your Contacts in many other applications.<br><br>

        <b>Can I send token using the application?<br><br></b>
        - Yes, you can send a token attached to an email or you can send a token by clicking the "Send Token" button at the top
        of the application.<br>
        Note: You can send tokens using nickname instead of wallet address.<br><br>

        <b>Can I run the application on localhost?<br><br></b>
        - Yes, the application can work on localhost.<br>
        Note: Clone the source code from the Github (or other code official repository) and follow the instructions to install
        and run the application.<br><br>

        <b>Is there a roadmap?<br><br></b>
        - No, although there are few features to be implemented, we don't have a deadline to develop them.<br>
        Note: HashBox Mail credits are not investment, so just buy HashBox Mail credits if you want to use them in the application.<br><br>
