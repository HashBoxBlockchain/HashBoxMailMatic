        Version 1.0.<br><br>

        Last Revised: April 24, 2023.<br><br><br>

        The HASHBOX Mail dApp ("dApp") is made available by HASHBOX BLOCKCHAIN LTDA, a private legal entity registered under CNPJ/MF number 50.624.228/0001-20, headquartered at Rua Santa Maria, number 221, room 509, Vila Hortência, Sorocaba/SP – Zip Code 18.020-216, hereinafter referred to as "HASHBOX", the sole owner of its intellectual property.<br><br>

        The provisions of the <a href="/terms" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a> and <a href="/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> of HASHBOX are automatically accepted by the User upon accepting these Terms.<br><br>

        The technical specificities of the HASHBOX Mail dApp must be analyzed through the protocol's <a href="/white-paper" target="_blank">White Paper</a>.<br><br><br>

        <b>1. OBJECT<br><br></b>

        1.1. Under the terms and conditions of this instrument, the use of the Decentralized Application (dApp) HASHBOX Mail is regulated, which is developed to enable decentralized sending and receiving of messages and digital files in Non-fungible Token (NFT) format using blockchain technology.<br><br><br>

        <b>2. DEFINITIONS<br><br></b>

        2.1. For the purposes of this agreement, the following definitions shall apply:<br><br>

        <div class="ms-3">
          2.1.1. dApp (Decentralized Application) - A decentralized application that uses a blockchain network as a platform to perform its functions. It is an application that operates as autonomous software and utilizes the infrastructure of a blockchain to securely and transparently store and process data.
        </div><br>

        <div class="ms-3">
          2.1.2. Blockchain - A distributed digital ledger technology that allows the creation of a shared and secure record of transactions and information. By using blockchain technology, the dApp ensures the decentralization and security of transactions. This means that exchanged information is not stored on a single centralized server, but rather on various nodes in the network, making the network more resistant to censorship, malicious attacks, and data loss.
        </div><br>

        <div class="ms-3">
          2.1.3. NFT (Non-Fungible Token) - A unique and non-interchangeable cryptographic token used to represent a unique digital asset, which ensures the authenticity and integrity of the exchanged information.
        </div><br>

        <div class="ms-3">
          2.1.4. Cryptographic Wallet - Software that allows the storage, receipt, and transfer of tokens, such as (BTC), (ETH), (MATIC), among others. The cryptographic wallet is essentially a cryptographic key that allows the user to access and control their cryptocurrencies.
        </div><br>

        <div class="ms-3">
          2.1.5. Public Address - A unique alphanumeric character string generated from cryptographic keys, which are used to authenticate token transactions. This address can be shared with others so that they can send tokens to your wallet.
        </div><br>

        <div class="ms-3">
          2.1.6. MetaMask - A cryptographic wallet for internet browsers that allows users to access blockchain-based decentralized applications (dApps). With Metamask, users can interact with these dApps directly from their browsers, without the need to install any additional software.
        </div><br>

        <div class="ms-3">
          2.1.7. IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) - A peer-to-peer file distribution protocol (P2P) that aims to decentralize storage and sharing of content on the internet.
        </div><br>

        <div class="ms-3">
          2.1.8. Credit - A utility token employed in the use of the services provided by the HASHBOX dApp.
        </div><br>

        <div class="ms-3">
          2.1.9. (MATIC) - A token belonging to the Polygon ecosystem, a blockchain platform that aims to improve the scalability and interoperability of decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum network.
        </div><br>

        <div class="ms-3">
          2.1.10. Smart Contract - A computer protocol that automatically executes contracts without the need for a human intermediary, characterized by a decentralized application based on blockchain that has the ability to verify, execute, and enforce contractual terms automatically.
        </div><br>

        <div class="ms-3">
          2.1.11. DeFi (Decentralized Finance) - A financial ecosystem built on top of blockchain technology that seeks to offer decentralized financial services without the need for traditional financial intermediaries such as banks or exchanges.
